```js
// #1 - Sort 10 schools around your house by distance:
// Insertion Sort, really fast, space complexity of O(1)

// #2 - eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount:
// Radix or Counting Sort
// These are fixed length numbers that need to be sorted, mostly small range

// #3 - Sport scores on ESPN:
// Quick Sort, we doubt that it would be sorted

// #4 - Massive database (can't fit all into memory) needs to sort through past year's user data:
// Merge Sort, we are not going to sort in memory, we are worried about performance

// #5 - Almost sorted Udemy review data needs to update and add 2 new reviews:
// Insertion Sort as its preordered

// #6 - Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada:
// if decimal then no radix, and Counting, so probably Quick Sort

// #7 - Large user name database needs to be sorted. Data is very random:
// Quick Sort

// #8 - You want to teach sorting for the first time:
// Selection Sort, Bubble Sort
```
