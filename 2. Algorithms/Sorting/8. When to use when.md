1. `Insertion Sort`:
   when items are less, it is very fast and mostly sorted data

2. `Bubble Sort`:
   Mostly never used, only for education purpose

3. `Selection Sort`:
   Mostly never used, only for education purpose

4. `Merge Sort`:
   Very good, because of divide and conquer, very fast,a nd worst case is `O(n log(n))`, but space complexity is high `O(n)`

5. `Quick Sort`:
   Actually better than Merge Sort, average case is `O(n log(n))` and less space complexity `O(log(n))`, but if we dont pick a good pivot, it can go to worst case `O(n^2)`

We can beat `O(n log n)`, by Non-Comparison Sort, only work with numbers, because of the way numbers are stored in memory

1.  `Counting Sort`
2.  `Radix Sort`
