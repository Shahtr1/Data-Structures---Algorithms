- A binary tree, every child belongs to parent node, that has greater priority or value, also called a `Max Heap`

- There is also a `Min heap`, where the root node is smallest

- In Binary Heap, all we are dealing with is that every node on higher level has a greater value than every node on the next level down.

- Can be used in any algorithm where ordering is important

```js
/**
    lookup -> O(n)
    insert -> O(log N)
    delete -> O(log N)
*/
```

- They are really great when doing comparative operations

- They are used in data storage, priority queue, sorting algorithms

- They take up least amount of space, left to right, no concept of unbalanced heap
