## Asymptotic notation

- ### Omega Notation

  - It is the formal way to express the lower bound of an algorithm's running time
  - Lower bound means for any given input this notation determines best amount of time an algorithm can take to complete

- ### Big O Notation

  - It is the formal way to express the upper bound of an algorithm's running time
  - Upper bound means for any given input this notation determines longest amount of time an algorithm can take to complete

- ### Theta Notation
  - It is the formal way to express both the upper bound and lower bound of an algorithm's running time
  - By Lower and Upper bound means for any given input this notation determines average amount of time an algorithm can take to complete
