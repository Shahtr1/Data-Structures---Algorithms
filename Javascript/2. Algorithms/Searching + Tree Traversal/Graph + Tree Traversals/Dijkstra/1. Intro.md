## Algorithm

1.  Maintain a set of processed nodes.
2.  Assign all nodes with distance value = infinity except source node (0)
3.  **Repeat following**: (unless all vertices are included)

    - Pick min value vertex which is not already processed
    - Include this selected node in processed set
    - Update all the adjacent node distances

      ```
        if( New distance < Old distance > ) then Update
        else Skip
      ```
